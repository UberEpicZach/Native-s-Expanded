 mesoamerican_reform_1:0 "A Unified Army"
 mesoamerican_reform_1_desc:0 "Our empire is made up of a number of minor city states that all acknowledge our central rule. While we can command the forces of all of these cities they are at the same time acting independently of each other and are paid for by their respective home cities. A unified army structure would ensure that less resources are wasted."
 mesoamerican_reform_2:0 "Central Arbitration"
 mesoamerican_reform_2_desc:0 "While they are unified under our rule, the city states of our empire frequently get into conflict with each other over everything from trade rights to border demarcation. By creating a central arbitration authority we can greatly reduce these tensions."
 mesoamerican_reform_3:0 "Central Armories"
 mesoamerican_reform_3_desc:0 "In times of war it has been customary for city states to arm the commoners in order to raise armies big enough to challenge their neighbors. As each state has its own armories the type and quality of arms can vary a lot within the empire. By creating a central system of armories from which all armies are equipped we can drastically increase the quality of our armed forces."
 mesoamerican_reform_4:0 "Tribal Expansion"
 mesoamerican_reform_4_desc:0 "Disorganized tribes control the lands on the outskirts of our territory. Let us build new settlements in these areas and absorb these peoples into our empire."
 mesoamerican_reform_5:0 "Reform the Bureaucracy"
 mesoamerican_reform_5_desc:0 "In order for our empire to grow at an acceptable speed we must create a new class of specialized administrators with the authority to quickly make executive decisions in newly conquered areas."
 religious_reforms.3.d:0 "Reforming our society will greatly strengthen our state, but has created tensions among the city states under our control and we will need time to recover our former glory."
